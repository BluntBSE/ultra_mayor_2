REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?

MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS? When 2 equally good paths are there?
POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.

LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

BUG: Tile beneath kaiju remains dark after context window popup
BUG: Tile beneath kaiju remains dark after fight starts
BUG: Right mouse does not close any open contexts

TODO: Animate cards as they resolve

POSSIBLY: Put card events in a bus so you can have good pauses after them and stuff.
