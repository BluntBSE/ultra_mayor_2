REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?
CONSIDER: Maybe not every pilot gets "Shove?" The ability to daisy chain shoves is pretty beefy.
Maybe a kaiju can only be shoved once or something?

MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS? When 2 equally good paths are there?
POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.

LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

####PLACING BUILDINGS####
TODO: Make the "construct" button open up the building menu
-Make it clear that clicking it again will close it
-Make clicking in the world close it (and right clicking if we don't want closer inspection)
-Make the menu close
-Upon hovering, open the tooltip panel
-Upon clicking a button, check to make sure the player has enough AP
-If not, make angry noise around AP.
-Make the buttons make a building outline follow the cursor as it hovers over tiles
-While the outline hovers over different terrain, update the tooltip panel accordingly.
-e.g: Most buildings require a development level of at least 1.
-While the outline hovers over terrain, update the radius of its effect in a hollow aura around the hexes
-Probably by having a stored "placing:..." variable
-This makes the button highlighted until it's placed
-Make right-clicking or an unhandled left click dismiss the placement.
-Upon left clicking, create a build command, add it to the event queue, then execute from queue
-Command must have: The building being placed, the location where it is being placed, the amount of AP spent, and the turn in which it was placed (for campaign reasons)
-Whence executed, put the real building down
-Development & Buildings are their own layer
-Apply its effect layer to the terrain in the given radius
-If appropriate, update its speed chart
-When mousing over a placed building, create a hollow outline of its effect radius.
-If the building is a power building, check to see if there are any existing power connections.

TODO: Really show what happens if the Kaiju has to move through a pilot


TODO: Make a decision about Kaiju pathing. Can they go through pilots or not?
Ideas: Maybe if a pilot goes down, the Kaiju moves into the pilots' space before continuing movement?
	
TODO: Win the kaiju battle  - does an event bus, if any, precede this?

POSSIBLY: Put card events in a bus so you can have good pauses after them and stuff.
