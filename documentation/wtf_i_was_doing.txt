REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?
CONSIDER: Maybe not every pilot gets "Shove?" The ability to daisy chain shoves is pretty beefy.
Maybe a kaiju can only be shoved once or something?

MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS? When 2 equally good paths are there?
POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.

LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.


--QUEUE--
TODO: Really show what happens if the Kaiju has to move through a pilot


TODO: Make a decision about Kaiju pathing. Can they go through pilots or not?
Ideas: Maybe if a pilot goes down, the Kaiju moves into the pilots' space before continuing movement?
	
TODO: Win the kaiju battle  - does an event bus, if any, precede this?

POSSIBLY: Put card events in a bus so you can have good pauses after them and stuff.
