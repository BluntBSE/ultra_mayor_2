REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


Path to highlight has to be moved to the pilot level, not the map level.

Maybe not HAS to be. But KAIJU for sure.

To do this properly, you must make path removal also tied to each pilot/kaiju

Add speedchart.

Allow Kaiju and Pilots to move into, or avoid, each others tiles respectively.

Should RenderedGrid and Grid just be variables accessible to occupants at all times? Idk
