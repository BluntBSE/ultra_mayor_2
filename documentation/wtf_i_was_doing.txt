REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?
CONSIDER: Maybe not every pilot gets "Shove?" The ability to daisy chain shoves is pretty beefy.
CONSIDER: Do pilots fully block Kaiju or not?
CONSIDER: What happens when a grid does not have enough power? Maybe an AP penalty per development?
Maybe a kaiju can only be shoved once or something?




--QUEUE--
BUG: Any tile that's already been hovered becomes an issue
Development might be better served as discrete buildings instead of the +1 style of the....
actually idk.
BUG: Can select multiple buildings to place at once.
Hover over tiles in build mode
Build development
Not-allowed reason





Upon button press, switch to Kaiju Attack mode.
Upon mech buildings, which themselves must specify what pilot they serve, spawn mechs of the given type.
Player state probably needs to track each pilot's unlocks etc. on a per pilot basis. A big dictionary?
Is a resource better? You're looking at: Array of upgrades, array of chosen cards, and array of possible cards.
Not too many. Serializing seems excessive so I'm going to vote keeping it in memory as a unique object class.

####PLACING BUILDINGS####
TODO: Make the "construct" button open up the building menu
-Make it clear that clicking it again will close it
-Make clicking in the world close it (and right clicking if we don't want closer inspection)
-Make the menu close
-Upon hovering, open the tooltip panel
-Upon clicking a button, check to make sure the player has enough AP
-If not, make angry noise around AP.
-Make the buttons make a building outline follow the cursor as it hovers over tiles
-While the outline hovers over different terrain, update the tooltip panel accordingly.
-e.g: Most buildings require a development level of at least 1.
-While the outline hovers over terrain, update the radius of its effect in a hollow aura around the hexes
-Probably by having a stored "placing:..." variable
-This makes the button highlighted until it's placed
-Make right-clicking or an unhandled left click dismiss the placement.
-Upon left clicking, create a build command, add it to the event queue, then execute from queue
-Command must have: The building being placed, the location where it is being placed, the amount of AP spent, and the turn in which it was placed (for campaign reasons)
-Whence executed, put the real building down
-Development & Buildings are their own layer
-Apply its effect layer to the terrain in the given radius
-If appropriate, update its speed chart
-When mousing over a placed building, create a hollow outline of its effect radius.
-If the building is a power building, check to see if there are any existing power connections.

####UPDATING POWER####

TODO: Really show what happens if the Kaiju has to move through a pilot


TODO: Make a decision about Kaiju pathing. Can they go through pilots or not?
Ideas: Maybe if a pilot goes down, the Kaiju moves into the pilots' space before continuing movement?
	
TODO: Win the kaiju battle  - does an event bus, if any, precede this?

POSSIBLY: Put card events in a bus so you can have good pauses after them and stuff.
