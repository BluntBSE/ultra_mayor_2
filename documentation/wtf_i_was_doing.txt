REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?

BUG: After player turn ends, you must queue free the state machines.
BUG: When using submit, arrows are going weirdly one slot to the right...
BUG: Type doesn't seem properly enforced during assignment
BUG: Deck doesn't seem properly shuffled between playthroughs. Randomize seed somehow?

NEXT:
SHARED CLASS FOR BUTTONS FOR INSPECT/RENDERED CARD UNPACK TO HAVE A REAL TYPE idk
Can probably put card inspection in there aghhh
Have an energy requirement
Multiple rounds of assignment
Unplay cards



SUBMIT UP TO X REQUIRES AN INTERFACE COMPONENT
MENUS ETC:
	-



MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS? When 2 equally good paths are there?

POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.


LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
act
