REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


BUG: Weird black spot under background of battle interface?

MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS?

POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.


LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
