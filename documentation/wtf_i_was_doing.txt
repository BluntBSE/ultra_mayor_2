REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


BUG: IF A PILOT IS ON THE TARGET, KAIJU CAN'T PATH TO IT, CAUSING A CRASH


TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
