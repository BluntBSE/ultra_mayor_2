REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


1. When there is already a selection in the map
2. The selection is a pilot
3. The pilot is adjacent to a kaiju
4. The player right clicks on a tile with a kaiju (may be step 3)

DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
act
