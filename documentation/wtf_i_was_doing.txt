REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?

BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH



Planning a pilot move inside of the Kaiju's projected path doesn't highlight it correctly.



probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow

the whole tile interaction thing gotta get fixed. Revert isn't enough. I think we might need specific events.

Hooking up display to hovers, selections

Turns?

When player hovers a possible pilot move, redraw the kaiju path in real time?

CONSIDER: Making occupants observe the tiles to which they are parented?
Could even have all tiles be observers of signals emitted at the map level instead of calling the tiles. Idk

Do I need to add reparenting of the occupants during movement?

Path to highlight has to be moved to the pilot level, not the map level. [Done for Kaiju]

Maybe not HAS to be. But KAIJU for sure.

To do this properly, you must make path removal also tied to each pilot/kaiju

Let's say that after ALL the movement stuff is in, let's try switching to a signal based pattern
If you do a signal based pattern, you could probably emit the current selections with every emission.

Add speedchart.

Allow Kaiju and Pilots to move into, or avoid, each others tiles respectively.

Should RenderedGrid and Grid just be variables accessible to occupants at all times? Idk
