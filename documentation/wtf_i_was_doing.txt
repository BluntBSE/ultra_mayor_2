REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


BUG: Kaiju can path through the pilot rn?

LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
