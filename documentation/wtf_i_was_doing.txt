---Card Color Categories--
95e0fa  - a kind of light blue
----
BUG: Can't draw cards if you right click to cancel a card play
TODO: When doing another thing that requires input, try using _unhandled_input instead
Learn about why that's better
SCRATCHED: Scaling text down if it doesn't fit
TODO: Angry energy noise when you don't have enough energy

TODO: Disable damaged pilots
TODO: Disable damaged Kaiju
TODO: Inspect graveyards/pilots/limbs?
TODO: Damage effect that shows a glimpse of what's lost?
TODO: Flee/Commit cycle for card battles
TODO: Win/lose state for battles
TODO: Add type interactions, and types to rendered_cards, including local terrain
TODO: Button modifier cards

STRONGLY CONSIDER (TODO): Implementing Memento and/or Command pattern. Possibly not needed in cards. Probably needed in city builder

MINOR BUG: KAIJU PATHS MIGHT REDRAW EVEN IF NOTHING ENTERS? When 2 equally good paths are there?
POSSIBLE FIX: Check and see if anything on the path of it is in kaiju_blocks to see if a redraw is necessary.


LogicalTiles currently parent themselves directly to the map. Is it worth putting them in a dummy node called LogicalTiles?
We mostly access them through the variable on the map.

TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
act
