REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


There are two distinct issues right now.

1) The Area2D on the pilotbuttons competes with the mousearea on the cards
2) If you wiggle back and forth really fast you can get the cards to inch upwards


TODO:
	-Consider consolidating your string events into a global enum
	-When entering battle mode...Hide tilemain? Don't save/reload?
	-Some cleanup logic for context menus is living in TileMain. Probably shouldn't be.


DONE: How to reparent RPilot without changing position -- it's probably okay if it's part of the movingpilot state.

probably need to go A* instead of breadth-first cuz it's slow
