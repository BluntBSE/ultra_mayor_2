REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?


REVERT on state machines was added to generically highlight UI elements and have them "go back to whatever they were before"

HEXAGONS:
	We're using XY cordinates with "odd-r" (odd y) offset to the right


BATTLES:
	The "Battle scene" is instantiated at the moment a turn is ended
	But is not populated with a battle object until it is given a battle from the battle filter
