REFLECT EVERY DAY: DOES TILEMAIN.MAP NEED A STATE MACHINE?

HEXAGONS:
	Pretty sure I am using an Odd-Q vertical layout, but with pointy hexes.

Development / Approval = AP per turn

Starts at 4, so 4 tiles = 1 AP/Turn


On a 1920x1080 display, try to display ~24 tiles across

Every RenderedTile tile has a "highlighted" state. Toggling of the states is organized at the TileMain level.

Honestly, use state machine to add or remove sprites from tiles too!

Need to figure out how to add building infrastructure and "buildings" together.
