Cards have:
	Origin: Player/Kaiju

	Instant Effects: --These occur as soon as a card is played, but before resolution
		Targets (0-5)
		Instant Effects (See list)
		Instant Effect Secondary Target (Redirect)
		Instant Effect value

	Resolve Effects: -- These only occur after "resolve"
		Targets (0-5)
		Effects
		Resolve Effect
		Resolve Effect Secondary Target <Maybe not?>
		Resolve Effect value

	Types (Physical, electrical, etc.)
	Affinities (Affected by terrain)

Things we'll need:
	Instant Stack:
		Unseen stack for all instant modifiers.
	Stack:
		Player cards resolve left to right.
	Energy Counter:
		Based on how many pilots there are. Reduced/restored as cards are played/removed, and on turn end.

	redraw_effects() - recalculate everything based on the current instant stacks. Done after any assigning of targets/playing of cards.
	do_instant_effect() - done when card is played
	undo_instant_effect() -- Primarily this means remembering Kaiju's & Players old targets.
	--Should we model instant effectsa as a stack of their own against Kaiju & Player? Probably!--
